Summer_placement_Cell_program_2025
Hii folks, I'm Aditya Gupta. I completed my schooling from ST. Joseph's Sr.Sec. School, Mahoba and currently I'm pursuing my bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication engineering from one of the top university, Jawaharlal Nehru University. 
This is the repo made for summer program that is being conducted by our SOE placement Cell. A big shoutout for them.
